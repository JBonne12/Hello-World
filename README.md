# Hello-World
First repository

Hello! 
I'm new to the coding world. 
I started along this path because my wife is going to be needing a website built in the next year or so.
I've always been interested in learning something in this area but have never pushed myself to create a project...until now.
I started a course on Udemy, "The Complete Web Developer Course 2.0", and since then I've been hooked!
